##  Design Philosophy 

Pipes was picked because our team wanted something other than object oriented programming languages. The goal was to highlight expressions and vector data types. The main focus of Pipes is data, how it is stored, manipulated, and used to help userâ€™s solve problems. This language might solve anything involving big data. Whether there is a long list of coordinates that need to be extrapolated or vector operations in complex mathematics operations, Pipes seeks to operate over these kinds of datasets efficiently. 

## Code Snippets

 Creating a  interger type variable.

`let x:int=32;`

Creating a  String type variable

`let x: str = "Hi!"`

Can also assign void to variable

`let x: void = ();`

Assigning a struct 

`let x: ex = {bar: 32, baz: \"Hi\",};`

Creating a list of type integer

`let x: [int] = [32, 17, -5];`

Example of creating a higher order function

`let x: (int -> int) = (a) { return 1 + a; };`

Creating a function

    func bad_adder(a: int, b: int,) -> int
        {
	        let x: int = a;
		let y: int = b;
		let result: int = a + b;
		return result;
	 }

Callning a function

`foo(x ,y);`

Creating a while loop

    while (x != 5){
        return true; 

Creating if-else loop

	if (x < 5) 
	    { return true; }
	else
	    { return false; }



Creating for loop

`for items in list return items`


## Limitations

## Lessons Learned 

If we had to do this all over, we probably would have made less ambitious decisions. The fact that our group had conflicting schedules and some of us worked full time, proved to be really difficult at the beginning to meet freely outside of class. This limited the amount of pair programming we could do, which probably would have been helpful for those of us less experienced. As far as language design goes, there is not much that we would change. We wanted a language focused on data and we all agreed that this would be the most interesting. With COVID-19, we had to choose a different target language regardless. Instead of web assembly we chose LLVM, because it would be simpler. Not only this but LLVM has more documentation available. 

## Compilation Process

Step 1:-   Make sure you have Rust installed in your computer
 
 For  MacOS or Linux 
 `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
    
 [Other Operating systems](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html#other-ways-to-install-rustup)

Step 2:- Clone latest version of the code base
`Git clone https://github.com/csun-comp430-s20/pipes.git`

Step 3:-  How to run the compiler?

 To compile a single file use command `rustc`  followed by `filename`

 Ex:- `rustc helloworld.rs`

 To build the whole project use command `cargo build`

Step 4:-  How to run the compiled code?

 To run the whole compiled project in one step use command `cargo run`


## Formal Language Defenition
`var` is a variable

`str` is a string

`int` is an integer

`bool` is a boolean

`void` is a null type

`*_name` is a user defined string

`func_name` is a function

`var_declaration ::= let var_name: type = exp`
`listy_type::= int | str | struct_name | bool |` Types available to lists

`list ::= [ exp,* ]` where exp is a listy_type

type ::= `int | str | bool | struct_name | list | type1 `=> type2
| void 

Built-in types & Custom Struct Types
`struct_type ::= struct_name { (field_name: (str | int | bool),)* }` 
Struct type

`struct ::= struct_name { (field_name: exp,)* }`
Create Struct Instance

struct_field `::= struct.field_name`
`op ::= + | - | % | / | * | < | > | <= | >= | == | != | && | ||` Arithmetic and logical
operations

exp `::= var | str | int | bool | struct | list | exp op exp | !exp | (var: type)` => exp
Variables, strings, and ints are expressions

function_def `::= func func_name ((param_name: type,)*) -> (type) block return
exp`; define function

function_call `::= func_name((exp,)*)` Calls a higher-order function

`stmt ::= var = exp; | if_stmt | while_loop | for_loop | return exp;` Variable
assignment, if statement, return statement

while_loop `::= while (exp) block` While loop

for_loop `::= for var in (list)` for loop

`if_stmt ::= if (exp) `block | `if (exp) block (elif(exp) block)`* else block if else
statement block 

`::= { stmt* }` Block
